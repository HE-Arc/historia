In fact, few monarchs worked harder for the greatness of their country than this princess, a stranger - by blood and culture - to her adopted homeland. She went down in history as the \"Great Catherine\".

After his death, he was at the centre of all discussions on Russian history. Catherine II constantly referred to her glorious predecessor. In the 19th century, conservatives blamed him for creating a social divide in the Russian world by separating the \"Europeanised\" nobility from a people who had remained in an essentially religious tradition. But when Russia was in danger, during the Napoleonic invasion in 1812 and the Hitler invasion in 1941, historians evoked the image of the patriotic tsar, devoted to the independence and grandeur of the state. And if in the early days of the Bolshevik revolution the emphasis was on the harshness of the ruthless dictator who spared neither the blood nor the sweat of his subjects, very quickly a more impartial portrait emerged, recognising both the faults and the qualities of the man, as well as the positive character of his work. Iconography, statuary and academic competitions have perpetuated the image of Peter the Great in his most diverse activities. The statue of Falconet, erected under Catherine II, near the Winter Palace, to the glory of the reforming tsar (1782), shows him indicating with an imperious gesture the site of his capital; the poet Pu�kin dedicated his \"Bronze Rider\" (1833) to him: \"Standing on the edge of the deserted waters, his mind full of great thoughts, he looks into the distance...\".",

There was a pathological element to his character that eventually degenerated into demented cruelty. The circumstances of his childhood had awakened in him a sickly distrust, a kind of nervous fear, a permanent state of irritation and a silent resentment against all beings: as a young man he had already lost his moral balance forever. But he was also one of the most educated men of his time, artistic, imaginative, hypersensitive; he astonished his contemporaries with his extraordinary gifts and the breadth of his political views. The little people always loved Ivan, who nevertheless made them suffer a lot; they venerated his memory and composed epic songs in his honour. It is the great ones who disgraced him, because they feared him; it is by the word \"formidable\" rather than \"terrible\" that the epithet of grozny which remains attached to his name should be correctly translated. To commemorate his victory over the Kazan Tatars, he had the famous St. Basil's Cathedral erected on Red Square.",

A woman of letters and science, she was the head of the Neoplatonic school in Alexandria, where she taught philosophy and astronomy. She was the first mathematician whose life is well documented. She is known during her lifetime as a renowned teacher and wise counselor. The only source listing her works, the Souda, attributes to her a commentary on the Arithmetics of Diophantus of Alexandria, which may have partially survived as part of Diophantus' original text, and a lost commentary on the treatise of Apollonius of Perga on conic sections. She also participated in the commentary or edition of Ptolemy's Almagest by her father. She also instructed other philosophers in the art of building astrolabes and hydrometers.  Although not a Christian, Hypatia was known for her tolerance of the early Christians. She taught many Christian students, including Snesios of Cyrene, the future bishop of Ptolemais. Until the end of her life, Hypatia advised Orestes, then prefect of Egypt, who was in open conflict with Cyril, bishop of Alexandria. Rumours that she was fostering conflict between Orestes and Cyril prompted a mob of Christian monks in March 415 to murder her, dismember her and burn her body. In particular, they were incited to kill Hypatia by a spiritual leader named Peter, under the influence of Cyril of Alexandria.  Her death at the hands of the Christians shocked the Empire and made her a 'martyr of philosophy', leading future Neoplatonists like Damascios to become fervent opponents of Christianity. During the Middle Ages, the symbol of Hypatia was reclaimed and distorted as an embodiment of Christian virtues; she may have been the origin of the legend of Catherine of Alexandria. During the Enlightenment, she again became a symbol of opposition to Catholicism. She became part of European literature under the impetus of Charles Kingsley in 1853, who wrote a novel about her life, and in the 20th century she became an icon of the women's rights movement and feminism. Many descriptions link her death to the burning of the Great Library of Alexandria, but the evidence shows that the two events are separate.",

Victoria was the queen of the world's leading industrial and commercial power. She was also the queen of the oldest parliamentary system in Europe, which was then considerably democratised and led by conservatives (such as Disraeli) and liberals (such as Gladstone). However, royal prerogatives were largely curtailed during her reign, and the Queen, who died in 1901, had less power than ever in England.

Archduchess of Austria, Imperial Princess and Royal Princess of Hungary and Bohemia, she was the second last child and youngest daughter of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria and Francis I, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. She became Dauphine of France in 1770, at the age of fourteen, through her marriage to the future King Louis XVI, then Queen of France in 1774, when her husband ascended the throne. After eight years of marriage, she gave birth to Marie Th�r�se, the first of her four children. She lost popularity due to accusations of sympathy with France's enemies, particularly her native Austria, and the affair of the necklace, where she was found to be the victim of a swindle. Demeaning nicknames, such as \"l'Autrichienne\" or \"Madame D�ficit\", circulated. Like her husband, she did not appreciate the constraints of the court and liked to spend time on her own, especially in the Queen's hamlet. At the beginning of the French Revolution, she was placed under house arrest in the Tuileries Palace, along with the royal family. Her attempted escape from Varennes in 1791 and her role in the war of the First Coalition further damaged her image. In 1792, the royal family was imprisoned in the Temple prison and the monarchy abolished. While Louis XVI was executed on 21 January 1793, the Queen's trial before the Revolutionary Court opened on 14 October; two days later she was convicted of high treason and executed by guillotine.",

        "text": "Under Elizabeth I, the small kingdom of England, surrounded to the north by an independent and hostile Scotland, to the west by an uncontrolled Ireland, and on the continent by the rise of the great absolutist monarchies of Spain and France, revealed itself, in the course of dramatic events, as a major partner in the European and world adventure. England asserted a personality that had matured during the Hundred Years' War, and was then forged by the masterly hand of the first Tudor kings. Shaped in turn by the cunning tenacity of Henry VII, then by the calculated outbursts of Henry VIII, it developed the social and economic foundations of its young power. The decline of feudalism, accelerated by government action, brought new actors onto the national scene: industrialists, merchants and 'adventurers' who gained strength at the expense of the old leaders of the political and economic game, the nobility and the Church. At the same time, the spiritual physiognomy adapted to the changing social structures; Henry VIII used his matrimonial adventures to break with Rome and place himself at the head of the Church of England, of which he controlled the episcopal body and secularised the monasteries. Encouraged by the \"Henrician reformation\", Protestant, Lutheran and soon Calvinist tendencies supplanted the old Catholicism, which had remained alive elsewhere, in government circles, in university and trading towns, and especially in London. Under the reign of Henry's successor, Edward VI, England moved decisively towards the Reformation, though not without sometimes strong resistance. Thus, original formulas were sought that would provide England with a religion adapted to the needs of its evolution. The Crown intended to free itself from Roman interference; but, despite their absolutist authoritarianism, the rulers were attentive to socio-economic trends and their spiritual corollaries. Parliament gained unparalleled influence by assuming supreme responsibility for the religious initiatives of Henry VIII and Edward VI. A new foreign policy also recognised the balance of power in Europe as the best way for England to participate as an arbiter in continental affairs, and especially in the increased exploitation of the major sectors of European trade. Society was undergoing profound changes, with the values of the \"manorial system\" already being challenged by those of urban, industrial and commercial capitalism, and the frenetic quest for money was combined with the taste for spiritual adventure that had long been expressed by so many learned and daring minds.",

Yet never was a son more concerned with continuing his father's work, with remaining faithful to his instructions. The Spanish king was deeply religious, sure of his rightful place and inclined to rigour.  The main features of his personality were a great capacity for work at the service of an average intelligence, a real shyness and a taste for solitude. Unlike Charles V, he behaved like a true Iberian, speaking only Castilian and Portuguese, and he never left the Peninsula after 1559. He was rid of the imperial title and the German wasp, and after 1581 he was master of two colonial empires, and was in fact more powerful than his father.  He did not like war, but allowed himself to be drawn into too many conflicts, in the Mediterranean against the Turks, in the Atlantic against England, in France against the supporters of Henry IV. The revolt in the Netherlands was the unhealable wound of the reign. The necessities of war forced Philip II to triple Castile's financial burdens. Was this the origin of the decadence? In part, no doubt. Recent research suggests that the epidemics of the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries contributed as much.",

Anne Boleyn's arrogant attitude soon earned her the enmity of the court. Although Henry VIII turned away from her and had affairs with other women, perhaps the birth of a boy could have saved their marriage. Anne Boleyn miscarried in 1534 and in January 1536 gave birth to a stillborn male baby. On 2 May 1536, Henry VIII had her imprisoned in the Tower of London for adultery with several men and incest with her own brother. She was unanimously found guilty by a court of peers and beheaded on 19 May. On 30 May, Henry VIII marries Jane Seymour.

Her father was called Scamandronyme and her brother Charoxus. Banished around ~ 600, she was exiled to Sicily and then returned to her native country to end her days there. Ovid, in the Eroids, depicts her as 'small and black', while Alceus, who may have loved her, speaks of a 'pure Sappho, with braids of violets and a smile of honey'. She was also the head of a sort of religious brotherhood where young noblewomen, destined to take part in the ceremonies of the local cults, learned to sing, dance, play the lyre and read the poets. Her marriage to Cercolas or Cercylas is an invention of the Athenian comic poets: in fact, it seems that she did not marry. Her unhappy love for Phaon, for whom she threw herself into the sea from the rock of Lefkada, is also legendary. Sappho's name is still associated with the idea of homosexual love. Despite the opinion of many critics who have argued for her 'virtue' by pointing to the dignity of her response to the proposals of Alceus, her concern for her brother who was seduced by a courtesan, or her outbursts of maternal love, it is undeniable that Sappho's love poems are addressed to women. (And she sometimes names herself in them, which proves that they are not poems commissioned by lovers.) The thesis that there were two women: a vulgar courtesan and a distinguished poetess remains rather implausible.",

Indeed, when a team of American archaeologists recently undertook a virtual reconstruction of the walls of the Temple of Aten at Karnak from talatates - a gigantic jigsaw puzzle of more than six thousand sandstone blocks removed from the Ninth Pylon - they were surprised to find that Nefertiti's depictions outnumbered those of Akhenaten, her royal husband.

He travelled through Turkey, Persia and above all China, where he stayed for twenty years. In the service of the Great Khan, as ambassador and governor, he travelled the country. As an attentive observer, he described the landscapes of Central Asia, collected legends, observed the daily life, customs and mores of the people he visited, and painted a fascinating picture of a kingdom where various religions coexisted peacefully. He evokes a country where gold and silk abound, but where a strange mineral and a viscous oil are also used, which will later be called coal and oil. And, above all, he paints an endearing portrait of an ideal emperor, the Great Khan Kubilai. Imprisoned in Genoa, the rival city of Venice, he dictated his memories to a fellow prisoner.",

        "text": "It would be fascinating to trace the curve of Shakespeare's reputation, for no other work, apart from the Bible, has attracted so much comment, so many scholars, so much controversy. But the consensus on the greatness and depth of the work is universal. Since the Folio that revealed this work to the world, its glory has not ceased to grow, so well established was it already among its own contemporaries.  Of course, every country and every era has its own Shakespeare. The eighteenth century began to establish the text, amended it and toned it down in places, sometimes adapting it to its own taste, and rewriting its plays by stripping them of their rough edges. In France, Voltaire was jealous of him, insulted him, but imitated him, or so he thought. Le Tourneur wraps it in the phraseology of the time with infinite precautions. Our Romantics adopt it and proclaim the revolution in its name. It was after the performances of Othello by an English troupe in Paris that Stendhal wrote his Racine et Shakespeare and exclaimed: \"We must now have a theatre of our own. Victor Hugo idolises and mythologises him. He forced his son Fran�ois to undertake the translation of his complete works, for which he wrote his thunderous essay. Since then, Shakespeare has become part of the French consciousness in the same way as our own playwrights. He is the classic with which we can take all sorts of liberties. It is translated, adapted and performed in all sorts of ways. It has taken over our stages, it haunts our festivals, it has almost become one of ours. Anyone who doesn't have his Shakespeare is considered illiterate.  And yet, it is hardly after the inordinate efforts of Anglo-Saxon critics, to whom we are beginning to listen, that Shakespeare begins to emerge from the fog of contemporary passions in a guise that we would like to be his own. It is not enough to make Shakespeare a precursor of Kafka, a zealot of leftism before its time, or a structuralist sociologist. Gesticulation and vociferation are not enough to give him his true face either. Between Brecht and the Com�die-Fran�aise, even under the direction of an English director, there is room for a careful rereading and informed reflection.",

        "text": "Of all the great politicians of the 20th century, Stalin was probably the one who had the longest impact on world affairs and the most profound transformation of his country. Churchill and Lenin had a major influence for only five years, Roosevelt and Hitler for twelve, while Stalin directly influenced the destiny of not only nearly two hundred million Soviets, but also an almost equal number of Europeans in the central and eastern part of the continent for a quarter of a century. Rarely has a politician aroused so much hatred and adoration. By the 1930s, Stalin had become an abhorred symbol for all those who fought communism, whether they were his closest competitors - the fascists and Nazis - or, on the contrary, whether they saw in the \"Man of Steel\" the embodiment of a new anti-humanism. But Stalin was also the object of a formidable cult, of a passion that was both revolutionary and messianic. If adoration was reserved for communist \"believers\", admiration for \"Marshal Stalin\" was widespread among non-communists; it was based on recognition of the victor of Stalingrad, who had largely contributed to the Allied victory over Nazi barbarism. A remarkable political strategist and tactician. Soviet society paid a particularly heavy price for the Stalinist model of transformation of the country: between 1930 and 1953, more than a million Soviets were sentenced to death as 'counter-revolutionaries' by a special court; seven million Soviets were deported, more than fifteen million experienced the Gulag labour camps, six or seven million died of hunger during two great famines (1932-1933; 1946-1947).  As the archives, declassified since 1991, have confirmed, the dictator played a decisive role in the elaboration and implementation of major political options, both on the domestic level (forced collectivisation of the countryside, accelerated industrialisation, purges and terror operations) and on the international level (anti-fascist turn and support for the \"Popular Fronts\" in the countries of parliamentary democracy from 1934-1935 onwards; the German-Soviet pact in August 1939; the definition of zones of influence in Europe in 1944-1945). The documents that are now accessible allow us to better identify the personal mark of the dictator in the management of the USSR and to analyse the way in which he exercised power.",

He invented the theory of heliocentrism, which states that the Sun is at the centre of the universe and that the Earth revolves around it. In contrast to geocentrism, this theory makes it easy to explain the observed movements of the planets, and to measure the distances of the planets from the Sun. He was a canon (a man of the cloth) His theories went against the beliefs of the time that the Earth was at the centre of everything. He kept his theory secret for 36 years out of scientific rigour. Indeed, he never managed to make it correspond perfectly to his observations. In 1543, at the time of his death, his theory of heliocentrism was published. His book was put on the Index (i.e. banned by the Church) in 1616 because it contradicted the theories of the time.",

He thought it would take him a few weeks, but it took him 6 years. He invented the word Satellite (which means \"Bodyguard\" in Latin) to refer to the moons of Jupiter. He grew up in difficult circumstances with a mercenary father in the army and a mother he said was small, thin and quarrelsome. He was a precursor of science fiction and wrote a book about the perception of our world by a person on the moon.",

His observations of the stars and planets were at least ten times more accurate than those of his predecessors in Europe. However, he made his observations with the naked eye and was the last astronomer before the invention of the telescope. He rejected the heliocentric system and preferred to establish a mixed system known as geo-heliocentric: the Earth is at the centre of the Universe, and the other planets revolve around the Sun. Johannes Kepler used his observations of the trajectory of Mars to find the laws describing the orbits of the planets around the Sun. He was also a pharmacist and created many remedies and elixirs. At the time of his death, he was the most popular scientist in Europe.",

He is credited with inventing the word geography. He calculated the length of the arc of the meridian between the two tropics. This value was recalculated and validated 2,000 years later by the French Academy of Sciences.

He conquered a large part of Asia. He was an exceptional and much feared conqueror because he totally destroyed the cities that dared to resist him. He began his military career at the age of 16. Fearing a revolt in Samarkand (a large city in Uzbekistan), he had to flee. Several years later, he officially became ruler and took the throne in Samarkand and made it his capital.  As emir of Transoxiana, Tamerlane proved to be a formidable warlord, building an immense empire based on military power and terror. Historians often refer to his destruction and massacres as the 'Timurid catastrophe'; estimates of the death toll from his military campaigns range from 1 million3 to 17 million people (about 5% of the world's population at the time)4. During his conquests, he did not hesitate to massacre the entire population of the cities that resisted him, with the exception of the artisans, whom he deported to Samarkand, his capital. It was in this capacity that he also showed himself to be the protector of the arts and letters that made Samarkand great.  He spent the next 30 years waging war and launching expeditions and built the third largest empire in the world. In each conquered city, he recruited the best craftsmen and scientists and sent them to Samarkand.  After Tamerlane's death in 1405, his empire, ruled by his descendants (the Timurids), was nibbled away by neighbouring powers until a final assault by the Uzbeks of the Chaybanid dynasty.   He died of illness at the age of 68, during an expedition to China. His tomb is in the Gur Emir (a mausoleum) in Samarkand. A legend says that his tomb is cursed. It is inscribed: \"When I return to the light of day, the world will tremble.",

Thanks to his political and military genius, he succeeded in unifying the Mongolian and Turkic tribes of Central Asia, thus creating the largest empire of all time. The childhood of the man then called Tem�djin is little known. It is believed that he was born holding a bone-shaped blood clot in his fist. During his youth, the Mongolian clans were torn apart by internal conflicts and guerrilla wars. They were divided and weakened against their main rivals: the Turks and the Tatars. When the young Mongol was barely 10 years old, his father was poisoned during a meal shared with the Tatars. The clan did not submit to the authority of the child, who was too young, and it was the Ta�djioutes who seized power. The future Genghis Khan spent many years wandering around with his family.  At the age of 19, Tem�djin had already built up a reputation as a fierce warrior and a fine politician, enabling him to unify the various Mongolian tribes little by little. In 1201, allied with the Chinese, he defeated the Turks, Tatars and Tajiks in several resounding battles. Five years later, he was named universal ruler (Genghis Khan) by the Mongolian people, due to his numerous victories on the battlefield. Mongolia was born. The conquests towards the neighbouring kingdoms, especially China, then began. In 1220, the Mongolian empire extended to the Muslim kingdom of Khwarezm, stretching between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf. After a final victorious campaign in China, Genghis Khan outlined his plans for the vast empire he had created to his youngest son. He died in 1227. His body was taken to a secret mausoleum in Mongolia.  He is considered the father of Mongolia and is now a legend. He established laws protecting women. After his death he is buried in a secret place that no one knows about. According to the legend, he is the descendant of a wolf, a wild hind and a woman impregnated by a ray of sunlight. He is also said to have killed a bear with his bare hands.",
