# Historia

As part of the web development course, a project using the Django framework must be carried out as a team.
The project must contain a database with an N-N relationship as well as different users.

## Project

The objective is to develop a quiz application on historical characters.

The user can start a game that can focus on a category, for example science. Then he have to answer a series of questions related to the theme.

Once the quiz is completed by the user, a score is calculated based on the number of correct answers. It is saved and displayed in a score panel at the end of the quiz as a leaderboard.
